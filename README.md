# Implementation of DNNs (AE) and INNs for reconstruction neutrinos

This repository includes the code of the dense neural networks (autoencoder) and invertible neural networks (Ardizzone et al., 2019) implemented using TensorFlow2 with Keras.

There are a few models in this repository: Our DNNs (AE) and INNs, which are the edited fork from [GitHub](https://github.com/jaekookang/invertible_neural_networks) created by jaekookang.

We use or/and edit it to do the backward reconstruction of di-nutrinos and neutrinos from the fully leptonic decay of the $HWW^{*}$ channel.
