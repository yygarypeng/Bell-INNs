# Implementation of machine learning to reconstruct W boson restframes from H -> WW -> lvlv decays

This repository contains the code to train a machine learning model to reconstruct the W boson restframes from H -> WW -> lvlv decays. The model is trained on the four-momenta of the final state leptons and the missing transverse energy. The model is trained on official mc samples.
